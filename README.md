# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains my data science pet projects and practical experiments.
The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my approach to data analysis,
statistical reasoning, and machine learning using Python.

## Structure

projects/
00_template/ # Base template for new projects
01_project_name/ # Individual data science projects


Each project is self-contained and includes:
- problem statement
- data description
- analysis and modeling
- conclusions and next steps

## Projects

| #  | Project | Description | Tools |
|----|--------|-------------|-------|
| 01 | Coming soon | Exploratory analysis and baseline modeling | pandas, numpy |
| 02 | Coming soon | Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing | scipy, stats |
| 03 | Coming soon | Machine learning classification | scikit-learn |

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- pandas, numpy, scipy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

```bash
py -3.12 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Open notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code and select Python 3.12 as the kernel.```
